# About our team and how we planed the development process:
The project was developed by a team of 8 people. We were working using Scrum methodology to ensure efficient collaboration and iterative development. This approach allowed us to break down the project into manageable tasks and deliver increments of functionality in short sprints, enabling quick feedback and adaptation. Utilizing Git for version control allowed us to effectively manage changes to the project codebase. JIRA served as our central hub for task management, where we could plan, track, and prioritize tasks, as well as report and manage any discovered bugs. TestRail played a crucial role in our testing process by providing a structured platform for planning and organizing test cases. Furthermore, Figma proved invaluable for visualizing user flows and interface designs.
